//! Ruler widgets are used to indicate the location of the mouse
//! pointer in a given window. A window can have a vertical ruler
//! spanning across the width and a horizontal ruler spanning down
//! the height. A small triangular indicator on the ruler shows the
//! exact location of the pointer relative to the ruler.

//! Either GTK1.Pixels, GTK1.Centimers or GTK1.Inches.
//! <p>The default measure is GTK1.Pixels.</p>

//! The lower and upper arguments define the extent of the ruler, and
//! max_size is the largest possible number that will be displayed.
//! Position defines the initial position of the pointer indicator
//! within the ruler.

//! draw the ticks
void draw_pos();
//! draw the position

//! The currently defined lower extent of the ruler.
